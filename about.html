								<h1>Arthur Adel</h1>
								<p>Arthur Adel was the creator of the world's first infrared telescope, the 
									discoverer of nitrous oxide in the earth's atmosphere and the Nitrogen Cycle, 
									detector of the atmospheric composition of Uranus and Neptune, and by discovering 
									the thick clouds of COz on Venus, was able to identify the greenhouse effect on
									that planet. In addition to a long list of scientific achievments, Adel was a 
									long-time Northern Arizona University professor, the originator of the NAU 
									astronomy program and sole professor of physics on campus for more than a 
									decade. Adel showed his brilliance early on as a University of Michigan 
									graduate student with his research into the barely explored infrared light 
									spectrum. This research gained him the attention of Roger Lowell Putnam, nephew 
									of Percival Lowell and trustee of the Lowell Observatory. The years Adel spent 
									at Lowell Observatory turned out to be some of his most productive and during 
									his time there he published numerous papers and made discoveries that are 
									still important today. After only a few years, Adel left Lowell and did 
									research for the military in New Mexico and after WW II ended, Adel turned 
									down a job offer from the Air Force to take a position at NAU for half the 
									salary. NAU now has an annual budget of more than $200-million, and millions 
									of that is spent on scientific research. Adel's decades of work on campus 
									enabled generations of NAU scientists to follow in the scientific quest, and 
									his work at the ARO has enabled many more astronomers to explore the cosmos 
									in a band of light once though to be blocked off by the atmosphere.</p>
								<h2>The World's First Infrared Telescope</h2>
								<p>Visible light from celestial objects is able to easily penetrate Earth's 
									atmosphere and reach telescopes on the ground. However, infrared light 
									from celestial objects is absorbed by molecules in Earth's atmosphere 
									and does not reach telescopes on the ground. Arthur Adel discovered a 
									small window that he could observe in where infrared light was leaking 
									through, that method is now famously called
									the 20-micron window. When Adel began his tenure at NAU in 1948, known 
									then as Arizona State Teachers
									College at Flagstaff, scientific research was virtually non-existent 
									on campus. The president at that time, Lucy Eastburn, told Adel he could 
									do research at the university as long as he
									didn't have to look for research funding within the state of Arizona. 
									Within several years of becoming NAU's only Physics Professor, Adel
									received a grant from the Air Force to continue his atmospheric research. 
									Employing his discovery of the 20-micron window and $89,000 in Air 
									Force funds, in 1952, Adel built the Atmospheric Research Observatory
									and the world's first infrared telescope. The observatory would take 
									its first observations in July of that year and go on to take thousands 
									more in the following decades. Over time, the observatory would prove 
									itself to be a resounding success, giving Adel a
									platform he continued to make discoveries on until his retirement in 1976.</p>
								<h3>The Barry Lutz Telescope Renovation</h3>
								<p>Modernizing the NAU observatory had been on the minds of physics and 
									astronomy faculty for years, but the department simply didn't have the
									funds to complete such a large project. Nearly five years ago though, 
									physics and
									astronomy faculty decided the time had come to begin fundraising. 
									In the period of just a few years, drastic increases in technology had 
									brought the price of a research-grade telescope and instrumentation 
									down to an amount the faculty thought they might
									raise. Donations poured in from the Flagstaff community, students, 
									and faculty from various departments, with many of the donations 
									coming from the physics and astronomy faculty themselves. Substantial 
									contributions were also made by the Office of the President, the 
									Office of the Provost, the Office of the Vice President For Enrollment 
									Management and Student Affairs, and the College of Engineering, 
									Forestry, and Natural Sciences, as well as Mrs. Frances McAllister. 
									Raising the $100,000 required to
									purchase the new telescope, however, would require a very large donor. 
									Barry Lutz, physics and astronomy professor and former physics 
									department chair, and Susanna Maxwell, NAU Vice Provost for Academic 
									Personnel, stepped up to the challenge. Lutz recognized the need for 
									equipment that would give students an opportunity to do meaningful 
									research and give professors a powerful teaching tool. Together the 
									couple provided half the funding needed for the telescope, a $50,000 donation,
									and in return the telescope was named in their honor.</p>
								<h4>The BLT</h4>
								<p>
									The Barry Lutz. Telescope for Educational Advancement and Training was 
									designed and built in Flagstaff by RC Optical Systems. The carbon-truss 
									0.5 f/8.1 Ritchey-Chretien telescope is
									a two mirror system that has no glass or refractive elements. The telescope
									 design is similar to most large, professional grade modern observatories, 
									 as well as
									the Hubble Space Telescope. To achieve exquisite quality, the telescope was
									 constructed
									from carbon fiber, titanium, and high-grade aluminum alloys. The BLT also 
									benefits from a state-of-the-art CCD (charged coupled device) camera that 
									provides researchers with incred-
									ibly high-resolution images of the cosmos. The telescope will provide 
									students and other researchers with the opportunity to do research on stars,
									 asteroids, comets and
									extra-solar planets among many other things. Along with the installation 
									of the new telescope, the observatory was also equipped with a modern 
									control room where researchers can sit in warmth and comfort while the
									computers capture their images.
								</p>
								<h5>Education and Research</h5>
								<p>
									One of the incredible aspects of
									attending a university that embraces undergraduate research, is the 
									opportunity for hands-on learning. In upper-level astronomy courses at 
									NAU, students will learn about the operation of a modern telescope away 
									from white-boards and power-points. Through the university's Observational 
									Astronomy course, students will be expected to learn the basic operations 
									of the BLT as well as the technology behind it. Then in the computer lab, 
									students will use the software packages required to analyze data from the
									telescope. By the end of the course students will be able to aquire, reduce 
									and analyze data.  These same students are then encouraged to apply for 
									time on the telescope to conduct research projects of their own. A number 
									of undergraduate research projects are also available to students who are
									certified to use the BLT. At most schools, students will learn little 
									astronomy until they get to graduate school. At NAU, any motivated student 
									can get the training and support to complete, publish and present their 
									own work â€”before graduation. Whether students decide to apply for graduate
									school or head straight into the workforce, this experience will give 
									them a jump on the competition.
