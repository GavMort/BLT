								<h2>Public Vieiwng</h2>
								<p>Free public telescope viewing is run by the NAU Astronomy Club during Friday evenings from 7:30pm-10:00pm when school is in session.
									Viewing is weather and staff dependant, so please check the current viewing outlook at the top of the home page.  Viewing is free and open
									to all members of the public, not just NAU students and staff.
									<br />
									When you arive, follow the path into the front door and continue down the hallway until you are greeted by us.  We will point you how to get up to
									the viewing floor and once up, the telescope operator will guide you through what we are currently viewing and how to look.  Feel free to
									enjoy some complementary hot cocoa and sign our guest book.  
									<br /> We look forward to seeing you there!
								</p>
								<p>No reservations or prior astronomy knowledge is required.  There is a small parking lot located next to the observatory by the ROTC building,
									or the San Fransisco parking garage down the street.  Parking day passes can be purchased on-site, we do not recommend parking without a proper pass.
									Please note: the telescope is located on the second floor of the building and is VERY steep.  Please use caution when cliombing up to the observation floor.
									Due to the steepness of the stairs, it may be difficult for small children or people with certain medical conditions or disabilities to safely ascend and descend.
								</p>
								<h2>Class Viewing and Research</h2>
								<p>The BLT is closed to the public Saturday-Thursday every week to allow NAU classes to utilize our fascilities.
									There are multiple classes that utilize the BLT and the telescopes inside the roll-of-roof observatories to learn the night sky and complete projects.
									The students in the AST401 lab utilize a CCD camera attached to the BLT in lieu of the eyepiece to conduct photometry on
									eclipsing contact binary star systems to calculate and graph their orbital periods.
